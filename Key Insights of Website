Website Performance Insights and Recommendations:

Key Findings 

Peak Activity Hours: Most people use the website around 7 PM to 9 PM. These hours are the best time to post new content or run campaigns.
Where Users Come From: Social media is the main source of new visitors. Other sources like direct visits, Google search, and email bring fewer users, so there’s room to improve those.
Social Media Visitors: Social media brings in many people, but their time on the site is about the same as other channels. This means it’s good for traffic, but not always for deep engagement or conversions.
Referral Traffic: Visitors who come from referral links (like other sites, videos, or emails) often engage the least. This shows the need to make referral content and calls-to-action more attractive.
Mixed Results from Social Media: Some social visitors are highly engaged, while many leave quickly without interacting. On the other hand, referral traffic may bring fewer visitors, but they are often more engaged.

 Weekend Performance

The website gets fewer visitors on weekends (Saturday and Sunday).
Wednesday stands out as the best day for engagement.
This makes Wednesday a good day to run promotions, share events, or post special offers.

Optimization Recommendations

Post at Peak Times: Focus on publishing content and campaigns between 7–9 PM when user activity is highest.
Boost Acquisition: Strengthen Direct, Organic Search, and Email channels through SEO, targeted emails, and direct marketing.
Improve Social Engagement: Optimize social content with interactive formats, clear CTAs, and better landing pages to increase engagement.
Refine Referrals: Test and optimize video and email referral content (A/B testing subject lines, video length, etc.).
Weekend Strategy: Share evergreen or community-focused content to lift weaker weekend sessions.
Leverage Wednesdays: Use Wednesdays for big promotions, events, or time-sensitive offers to maximize strong midweek engagement.
