Project Overview: Website Data Analysis using Python and Gemini AI in Google Colab
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of website data using Python in Google Colab, with extensive support from Gemini AI to streamline and enhance the analytical workflow. The objective was to uncover meaningful insights from the websiteâ€™s data through systematic preprocessing, exploration, and visualization.

The key steps undertaken in this project include:

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and standardized formats to ensure data quality.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed in-depth analysis to identify patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.

Data Formatting: Structured and transformed the data to make it suitable for visualization and interpretation.

Visualization: Created a variety of charts and graphs (e.g., bar charts, line plots, pie charts) to present data-driven insights effectively.

AI-Powered Insights: Utilized Gemini AI for summarizing trends, generating visual interpretations, and refining key takeaways.
