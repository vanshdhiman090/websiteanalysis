# 📊 Project Overview: 
Website Data Analysis using Python and Gemini AI in Google Colab

In this project, I carried out a comprehensive analysis of website data using Python in Google Colab, with the support of Gemini AI to enhance the efficiency and depth of the analytical process. The primary goal was to extract meaningful insights from raw website data through systematic preprocessing, exploration, and visualization.

## 🔧 Key Steps in the Analysis:
Data Cleaning:
Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and standardized data formats to ensure high data quality and reliability.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conducted detailed analysis to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations within the dataset.
Data Formatting:
Structured and transformed the dataset to optimize it for analysis and visualization.
Visualization:
Created insightful visualizations including bar charts, line plots, and pie charts to effectively communicate findings.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used:
Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis
NumPy – Numerical operations
Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization
Google Colab – Cloud-based coding environment
Gemini AI – AI-assisted exploration and insight generation
